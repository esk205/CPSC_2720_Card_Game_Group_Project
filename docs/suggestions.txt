	1. rank variable in Card class should be renamed to pip (named of card number/face), because rank is a reserved word.
	2. Potentially use a enumeration for pip instead of a string
	3. The UML diagram doesn't have a method for Play() in Game.
	4. In the Deck UML diagram +addCard(Card card) is missing a method type.
	5. In the UML diagram some consructors are not consistantly written out.
	6. In the UML diagram for Choices remove() shouldn't be used as a method name... reserved word. same with clear(), and size(). Suggsest removeChoice(), and clearChoices(). Not sure for size();
	7. Player should have a constructor that sets name???
